# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here
I made several changes to the original function to make it more readable and maintainable. Here are some of the main changes I made:

Removed unnecessary comments: The original function had a comment that was not really adding any value. I removed it to reduce noise and make the code easier to read.

Used consistent naming conventions: The original function used different naming conventions for variables and constants. I used camelCase for all variables and constants to make the code more consistent and easier to read.

Simplified if statements: The original function had several nested if statements that made the code hard to follow. I simplified these statements by using early returns and guard clauses. This makes the code more readable by reducing indentation and making the code flow more logically.

Added default parameter: I added a default parameter for the event argument to make it clear that the function can be called with an undefined or null value. This also reduces the need for explicit checks for undefined and null values, making the code simpler and more concise.

Improved variable names: I renamed some of the variables in the original function to better reflect their purpose. For example, I renamed the variable h to hash to make it clear what it represents. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, I believe my refactored version is more readable than the original because it removes unnecessary complexity, simplifies the control flow, and uses consistent naming conventions. By simplifying the code, I made it easier to understand and modify, which is important for long-term maintainability. Additionally, by adding unit tests to cover all possible scenarios, I ensured that the function's behavior is well-defined and that any future changes won't break the existing functionality.
